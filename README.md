- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dinesh kumar M

Reach out to me via email: mdineshkumar2416@gmail.com

Currently pursuing a Master of Technology in Biomedical/Medical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, I have recently completed a Winter Internship at DentalPaas, where I delved into product design and the development of a cutting-edge intraoral 3D scanner. My core competencies lie in product design, development and provide innovative solutions to healthcare, a skill set that was crucial in my prior role as Project Associate at IIT Madras

At IIT Madras, our team successfully transitioned a VR training simulator to a market-ready product, which included my contribution in Hardware. I am eager to bring these diverse perspectives and experiences to a team that values innovation and collaboration, and where we can collectively push the boundaries of biomedical technology.
